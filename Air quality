This Python program predicts air quality by leveraging historical environmental data and machine learning algorithms. It collects key parameters such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃ levels, along with meteorological factors like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The data is preprocessed and used to train a regression or classification model—such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or a neural network—to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) or categorize air quality levels (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy). The program enables early warnings and supports public health decisions by providing accurate, real-time air quality predictions.
